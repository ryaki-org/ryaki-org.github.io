## Legal

* We need to define a legal document that describes the custodian organization and the exchange firm. We need to do this for every country.
* What are the legal requirements for the existence of the ryaki exchange network?

## Programming

* We need a payment system to process external payments with the use of phones so as to reduce any bureaucratic needs in the [[ryaki exchange firm]].
* We need to program the [[ryaki node]] software.
* We need to provide a good collaborative tool to allow for peer to peer processes to happen.


## Economics

We need a formal proof that the system has these 2 characteristics:

* the ryaki network has an economic advantage that will lead its internal network to expand.
* there doesn't exist an accumulation of value to a small number of people.

We need to find any possible financial rule incosistencies that make the network impossible to function.

We also need to chech for the existence of economic behaviour that could potentially remove the above characteristics.
