A **production schema** defines the types of Equipment, the production processes and the people that will take part in the production.

The **production schema** is characterized by its **entropy**.



## Entropy

The entropy of a production schema is a property that describes the ways that the production schema allows the production to change.

There are two things to consider about entropy.

* An increase in the entropy of the system can lead to an increase in productivity. (Ex. see the linux kernel)
* An increase in the entropy can also lead to an increase in the risk of investment on this production schema.


There are 2 distinct ways that contribute ot the entropy of the schema:

### People 

The production schema defines rules that describe which people are eligible to take part in production.
 The rules must define ways to acertain the proficiency and integrity of a person. Access rules to equipment is part of these rules.


### Production processes

The production proceses can either remain the same or change, meaning that the equipment and people are reorganized in different ways to produce a different or the same product.



There is a specific case in which the production processes are not defined. In this case any [[production unit]] can use the tools as long as they abide by the remaining rules of this schema and the rules of the [[investment unit]].
