A **producer** is any person that produces things as part of a [[production unit]]. A producer can be a [[credit source]] and depending on the number of times it created credit, it can have multiple [[investment equation]]s.

As a credit source, it is important to know what kind of production the producer will most probably take in the future. To achieve that we have the below tools:

* All previous productions of commodities are open for the public to see. This can show the type of production th person likes or/and has skill in.
* Certification of the skills of a person can do the same thing but it can not detect the willingness of the person to work.

Because people can and should engage in [peer to peer production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production), producers can produce many things and in different [[investment unit]]s and [[production unit]]s. These have their investment and value equations which determine the value that a producer receives. 

Thus we can only have an estimate on the type of work that a producer will do or the amount of value that a producer will receive.

Because of that, we call the producer an **abstract credit source**.
