An **investment schema** is bound by the rules of the [[financial system]] of Ryaki and is characterized by :

* a [[production schema]].
* an [[investment equation]].
* a sum of money that is required for such a schema to be materialized.
* a [[profit equation]].

An **investment unit** is a materialized investment schema. 

For an investment schema to materialize, a [[ryaki custodian]] must accept to upheld the rules defined in the pruduction schema and a [[ryaki exchange firm]] must agree to distribute the revenue from the sales based on the [[investment equation]] and the [[value equation]] that any [[production unit]] would agree on. When the sum of money is reached, the investors receive [[credit]] that follows rules defined in Ryaki's [[financial system]].
