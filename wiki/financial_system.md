Ryaki's financial system is composed of a number of financial accounts , and rules that allow for payments to happen  either inside it or with the external financial system.


* We call someone a **ryaki member** if he has been verified to be a person by a [[ryaki custodian]].

* A ryaki member can choose to trust that a [[credit source]] will be able to return a sum of money due to the production that it will engage in the future. The ryaki member creates an account on this credit source and specifies the limit of credit that it can hold. 

We call this a **trust line** from member \\(m\\) to credit source \\(c\\) with limit \\(l\\). 

**[[investor unit]]s or [[production unit]]s cannot create trust links. Their only purpose is to produce things. They do not hold any financial accounts.**

## Exchangeability between 2 trust lines.

* For any two trust lines that a member has, the member agrees that any transfer of credit from one account to the other is permitted.

* An internal ryaki payment is a transfer of credit from one member to the other for the purchase of a product and can happen through a trust chain as long as the limits are respected.

**An internal transfer of credit from one member to another can only happen for the purchase of a product.**

* For each credit source , each payment uses the trust lines of its investors with a fair queuing algorithm.

* For external payments, each payment continues to use the [fair queueing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_queuing) algorith as long as the [[investment equation]] and [[value equation]] are respected.

Because of the above algorithm, it is better to distribute one's funds to multiple credit sources.
