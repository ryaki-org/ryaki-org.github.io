An **investment equation** is an equation that determines the percentage that the investors receive from the sale of one commodity that has been produced with the use of their [[investment unit]] or by the producer in which they have invested. After each sale, the cooresponding sum is subtracted from their credit.  The [[ryaki exchange firm]] is resposible to uphold the equation.

## Investment unit equation

An investment unit can only have one equation at the time of its creation.

There are 2 possible senarios when a sale happens:

* The sale happens in the external market. In this case, if the commodity is sold at a price \\(p\\) and the percentage is \\(ie\\) then the investors will receive \\(p*ie\\).
* The sale happens inside the ryaki [[financial system]]. In this case, There is a possible absense of conections to make the payment. Ther are 2 possible senarios:
    * The investors do not have enough connections. In this case, the payment doesn't happen.
    * The producers do not have enough connections. In this case, the payment is routed through the accounts of the investors. The producers receive [[investment credit]] from this investment unit that has first priority to be used to route payments so that the percentage is respected in the long run. Those payment will have to be internal though.

## Producer Equation

A producer's equation determines the percentage of value that the investors receive while the remaining is kept by the producer. For the same reasons, internal payment respect that percentage in a best effort fashion.

Producers can create credit multiple times and thus can have multiple investment equations.
