**Definition 1**

* Let \\(c_i \in C\\) be the credit sources.
* Let \\(b_i \in P\\) be the producers.
* Let \\(i_{ci} \in I_c\\) be the capital investors, members or ryaki that have invested in investment units.
* Let \\(i_{pi} \in I_p\\) be the members or ryaki that have loaned producers.

* Let \\(n_i \in N\\) be the number of investors at credit source \\(c_i\\).
* Let \\(I_{ei}\\) the investment equation percentage for credit source \\(c_i\\).
* Let \\(V_{ei}\\) the value equation percentage for production unit \\(P_ui\\).
* Let \\(P_{ui}\\) be the profit equation of credit source \\(c_i\\).
* Let \\(p_i \in P\\) be the production rate of credit source \\(c_i\\).
* Let \\(p_{ri} \in P_r\\) be the price of the product of credit source \\(c_i\\) expressed in ryaki currency.
* Let \\(e_i \in E\\) be the exchange rate of credit source \\(c_i\\) expressed in ryaki currency.

**Lemma 1**

$$e_i <  p_ip_{ri}$$

**Investor Exchange rate** 

The investor exchange rate \\(i_{eri}\\) is equal to:

Cases:

* Investment unit
$$ i_{eri} = e_iI_{ei}$$

* Producer
$$ i_{eri} = e_j(1-I_{ej})V_{ei} $$




**Definition 2**

We call \\(r_{ci} = \frac{i_{eri}}{n_i}\\) the current average rate of exchange per investor for credit source \\(c_i\\).


**Lemma**

Let \\(m_{ij}\\) the amounts of credit that investors \\(i\\) have on credit source \\(c_i\\) in increasing order of quantity.
Then the average rate of exchange per investor for an investor that has \\(m_{ij}\\) credit is given by this equation:
$$R:R \rightarrow R$$
$$R(m_{ij})= \frac{m_{ij}}{\sum_{l=1}^{j}\frac{(n_i-l-1)(m_{il}-m_{il-1})}{i_{eri}}} $$  where \\(m_0=0\\).
