There could be many probable reasons for the existence of a tendency of accumulation of value. Ryaki is resistant to one such reason, the time phase problem. It can also be said that all other reasons are minor or have an upper boundary.


## The time phase problem

The time phase problem is the emperical observation that for every investment that happens, there is a period of time till the original sum of money that was invested returns to the investors. We call this the **investment time phase**.

The time phase problem necessitates a surplus of money for an investment to start. Thus money centralizes the power over the economy to those that have it. The humans needs play a secondary role. The people who need a commodity cannot decide to produce it, they simply can't. They can only wait their benefactors, the investors. In other words the financial system has complete control of the economy.

The centralization of financial power also leads to similar oligarchic forms of ruling inside the enterpises. Having alienated the producers from the fruits of their labor, that structure is necessary to impose obedience.

## The existence of money as an Information problem

The [General Equilibrium Theory](https://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20202/General%20Equilibrium.pdf) proves that if everyone had knowledge of their utility functions, we knew the production capabilities of the industry, then there is a pareto optimal Walrasian Equilibrium. The solution is the set of prices of the commodities and the amount of consumption each person will have.

In this case, there is no need for money, only a set of prices with which to exchange the commodities directly. Prices are assumed to be denominated on a common measure of value but that measure of value doesnt take physical form in the sense that like a meter that expresses the length of a path, it is a property of the commodity and not an external object.

### Money and Incomplete information

On the other hand, when one doesn't know the type of commodities he will want in the future, or the type of product it will produce, that requires the existence of a physical measure of value that can be exchanged till one exchanges it with the commodity he wants. It can be another commodity that is generally accepted like Gold, or fiat money, it doesn't make a difference as long as someone can store in them 'exchange' value to be used later.



## Ryaki's Solution

In Ryaki, there is a common measure of value, the [[ryaki currency]] in which all credit is denominated. Credit in ryaki plays the same role that money play in the external market. It is a way to store value to be used later. On the other hand, ryaki guarantees that all internal transactions are performed with zero interest. Investors credit in an investment is equal the credit they gave to that investment. Thus it is impossible to take advantage of the time phase problem.
