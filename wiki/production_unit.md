A **production unit** is a group of people that makes use of one or more [[investment unit]]s and thus accept their governing equations. They democratically agree on a [[value equation]].

The production unit needs to accept the [[production schema]] of the investment units it uses.
Thus its organizational structure and dynamism depends both on the members' wants and the limits that the schema instills.

Members of the production unit are [[producer]]s.
