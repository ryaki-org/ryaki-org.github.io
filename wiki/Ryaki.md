**Ryaki** is a new financial and production system. Ryaki consists of a number of [[producer]]s that group in [[production unit]]s and use [[investment unit]]s. Its members connect to form the [[ryaki payment network]].

The ryaki system introduces an exchange layer on top of the [Open Value Network](//ovns.github.io) model.

The ryaki system has some characteristics:

* It has an [[economic advantage]] that will lead its internal network to expand.
* There are no [[financial middlemen]].
* There doesn't exist a [[tendency of accumulation of value]] to a small number of people.
