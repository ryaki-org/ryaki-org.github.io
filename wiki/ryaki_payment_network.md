The **ryaki payment network** is composed of [[credit source]]s, [[ryaki member]]s and [[trust link]]s and a set of rules for routing [[ryaki payment]]s inside the network.

# Routing

1. For any two trust links of a ryaki member, credit can flow from one to the other automatically.
2. For each credit source, the trust link that is chosen for the transfer of credit is determined by the [[fair queue algorithm]].
