An entity that is able to manage the commodities/credit/money of others' entities is called a **financial middleman**.

In ryaki there cannot be financial middlemen by design, since trust links have the exchangeability property if they have the same origin and thus the same direction.

Specifically, 
* investment units do not have financial accounts at all.
* producers cannot draw funds from his loans to invest them. He can only use the loans to buy commodities.
