An entity that is able to manage the commodities/credit/money of other entities is called a **financial middleman**.

In ryaki there cannot be financial middlemen by design, since trust links have the exchangeability property if they have the same origin and thus the same direction.

Specifically, 

* [[investment unit]]s do not have financial accounts at all.
* [[producer]]s cannot draw funds from their loans to invest. He can only use the loans to buy commodities.
