**Informal proof** Help me make it formal.

The ryaki network is a membrane system that contains [[credit source]]s that produce commodities and create credit and investors, members who have acquired credit from a number of credit sources. 

When an external investor invests in an investment unit, he receives a profit based on the [[profit equation]].

An [[investment schema]] requires a specific sum of money to materialize, let's call it \\(m\\).
Internallly, the investment unit can buy equipment depending on its availabity on the network of value \\(r\\).
If we assume that the prices of the equipment are equal if they are bought from an external supplier or from inside, then the investment schema will only require \\(m-r\\) external investment. Given that internally, all investment happen at 0 profit, it is obvious that the external investors will be able to propose a profit equation that gives them higher per capital than if they invested in an external investment in which everyone would get a profit.

Is the price of the commodities inside the network cheaper than external ones?

They can only be cheaper or equal than any external commodity assuming the same productivity since some of the equipment required for the production was bought with funding that asked for zero profit.
