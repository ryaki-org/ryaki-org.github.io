A [[ryaki member]] can choose to trust that a [[credit source]] will be able to return a sum of money due to the production that it will engage in the future. The ryaki member creates an account on this credit source and specifies the limit of credit that it can hold. 

We call this a **trust link** from member \\(r_m\\) to credit source \\(c\\) with limit \\(l\\). 

**[[investment unit]]s or [[production unit]]s cannot create trust links. Their only purpose is to produce things. They do not hold any financial accounts.**
